## What is Fiddler Auditor?

Language models enable companies to build and launch innovative applications to improve productivity and increase customer satisfaction. 
However, it’s been known that LLMs can hallucinate, generate adversarial responses that can harm users, and even expose private information that they were trained on when prompted or unprompted. It's more critical than ever for ML and software application teams to minimize these risks and weaknesses before launching LLMs and NLP models. As a result, it’s important for you to include a process to audit language models thoroughly before production.
The Fiddler Auditor enables you to test LLMs and NLP models, identify weaknesses in the models, and mitigate potential adversarial outcomes before deploying them to production.

## Installation

### From Poetry
Auditor supports the Poetry package management system and we test on Python 3.8 and above.  We recommend creating a virtual python environment using Poetry and installing using the following command

```bash
poetry install
```
This will install the dependencies listed in the pyproject.toml file and install the local virtual environment if Poetry is configured to do so.

After installing, run the tests to confirm all dependencies are installed and fiddler-auditor is functioning.  
```bash
poetry run pytest -v -s
```

>**NOTE:** Run the above test command twice as the first time will trigger downloads of transformer assets and fail, but rerunning the tests should pass.


### From PyPI
Auditor is available on PyPI and we test on Python 3.8 and above. We recommend creating a virtual python environment and installing using the following command

```bash
pip install fiddler-auditor
```

### From source
You can install from source after cloning this repo using the following command

```bash
pip install .
```
